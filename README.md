Some cool projects that I've worked on!

Here you can find some interesting (public) projects that I've done to anaylze and interpret data:

_(Some Jupyter notebook links here will be rendered off GitHub at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org due to GitHub rendering issues)_

--[**Tesla Order Scheduling Challenge**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/Tesla%20Order%20Scheduling%20Challenge.ipynb): an decision-making model to determine the schedule of parts and trucks needed to minimize logistics costs while maintaining an adequate stock of materials for production

--[**Zipline Data Challenge**](https://github.com/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/Zipline%20Drone%20Data%20Exploration%20-%20Conner%20Reinhardt.ipynb): an analysis of drone flight data that I've put together to understand trends around sensor recordings shortly after takeoff

--[**SeniorDesign-VenueDataExploration**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/conner.reinhardt/viz/DataExplorationFINAL/ItemProjections) [*View data pipeline*](https://github.com/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/%20SeniorDesign-VenueDataExploration.ipynb): an analysis of sporting venue data to understand the predicting factors around food/beverage consumption for guests

--[**Tech Trolley Analysis**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/conner.reinhardt/viz/PassengerCounter/Dashboard): a data visualization tool created for the GT Parking and Transportation organization to understand ridership and trends on the local bus and trolley service on campus

--[**Cheapest Insertion - Shortest Path**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/CheapestInsertion-ShortestPath.ipynb): Running a quick test to understand the cost differences between nearest neighbor and cheapest insertion algorithms

--[**Basic Gurobi Optimization**](https://github.com/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/GurobiOptimizationProblemSet.pdf): A few problems that involve linear programming (determining optimal task starting times and step sequences in project) in Gurobi

--[**Gurobi Inventory and Blending**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/Gurobi_InventoryandBlending.ipynb): A few problems that involve inventory order allocation and blending of materials to make product

--[**Goodvs/Bad Weather Distributions**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/GoodvsBadWeatherDistributions.ipynb): Generating two distributions of the time it takes for planes to takeoff after they have been deiced at an unnamed airport in China. This script models both good and bad weather day distributions and then creates a merged distribution based on the probability of the weather being foul
