Some cool projects that I've worked on!

Here you can find some interesting (public) projects that I've done to anaylze and interpret data.

Check out the Zipline Data Challenge (jupyter notebook) to see an analysis of drone flight data that I've put together to understand trends around sensor recordings shortly after takeoff.
