Some cool projects that I've worked on!

Here you can find some interesting (public) projects that I've done to anaylze and interpret data.

--**Zipline Data Challenge**: an analysis of drone flight data that I've put together to understand trends around sensor recordings shortly after takeoff

--**CheapestInsertion-ShortestPath**: Running a quick test to understand the cost differences between nearest neighbor and cheapest insertion algorithms

--**GurobiOptimizationProblem
