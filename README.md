Some cool projects that I've worked on!

Here you can find some interesting (public) projects that I've done to anaylze and interpret data:

--[**Tesla Order Scheduling Challenge**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/Tesla%20Order%20Scheduling%20Challenge.ipynb): an decision-making model to determine the schedule of parts and trucks needed to minimize logistics costs while maintaining an adequate stock of materials for production

--[**Zipline Data Challenge**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/Zipline%20Data%20Challenge.ipynb): an analysis of drone flight data that I've put together to understand trends around sensor recordings shortly after takeoff

--[**Cheapest Insertion - Shortest Path**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/CheapestInsertion-ShortestPath.ipynb): Running a quick test to understand the cost differences between nearest neighbor and cheapest insertion algorithms

--[**Basic Gurobi Optimization**](https://github.com/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/GurobiOptimizationProblemSet.pdf): A few problems that involve linear programming (determining optimal task starting times and step sequences in project) in Gurobi

--[**Gurobi Inventory and Blending**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/Gurobi_InventoryandBlending.ipynb): A few problems that involve inventory order allocation and blending of materials to make product

--[**Goodvs/Bad Weather Distributions**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/connerreinhardt/datascienceprojects/blob/master/GoodvsBadWeatherDistributions.ipynb): Generating two distributions of the time it takes for planes to takeoff after they have been deiced at an unnamed airport in China. This script models both good and bad weather day distributions and then creates a merged distribution based on the probability of the weather being foul
