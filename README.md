Some cool projects that I've worked on!

Here you can find some interesting (public) projects that I've done to anaylze and interpret data.

--**Zipline Data Challenge**: an analysis of drone flight data that I've put together to understand trends around sensor recordings shortly after takeoff

--**Cheapest Insertion - Shortest Path**: Running a quick test to understand the cost differences between nearest neighbor and cheapest insertion algorithms

--**Gurobi Optimization Problem Set**: A few problems that involve optimization modeling to make informed decisions in Gurobi (linear programming) 

--**Goodvs/Bad Weather Distributions**: Generating two distributions of the time it takes for planes to takeoff after they have been deiced at an unnamed airport in China. This script models both good and bad weather day distributions and then creates a merged distribution based on the probability of the weather being foul
